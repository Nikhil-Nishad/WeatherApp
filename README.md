Weather App Shows Current Weather with the Help of Rapid Api


Welcome to my weather app website! This website was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the RapidAPI service. The goal of this project was to create a simple and easy-to-use weather app that allows users to quickly and easily check the current weather conditions for any location.

The site allows users to search for the weather of any location by typing in the city name or zip code. Results are displayed in an easy-to-read format and include the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the current weather conditions.

The weather data is pulled from the RapidAPI service, which provides real-time and accurate weather information for locations around the world. The site is also fully responsive, meaning it will adjust to the size of the screen it is viewed on, so you can access it from any device.

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out through the contact form or email provided.

Thank you for visiting my weather app!
